						<Item title=" What is CORS used for?">
							Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) is an HTTP-header based
							mechanism that allows a server to indicate any origins (domain,
							scheme, or port) other than its own from which a browser should
							permit loading resources

							title="Why are you using firebase?
             What other options do you have to implement authentication?">
							The Firebase Realtime Database lets you build rich, collaborative
							applications by allowing secure access to the database directly
							from client-side code. Data is persisted locally, and even while
							offline, realtime events continue to fire, giving the end user a
							responsive experience.
							<br />
							Firebase Authentication provides backend services, easy-to-use
							SDKs, and ready-made UI libraries to authenticate users to your
							app. It supports authentication using passwords, phone numbers,
							popular federated identity providers like Google, Facebook and
							Twitter, and more.
						</Item>
						<Item title="How does the private route work?">
							The private route component is similar to the public route, the
							only change is that redirect URL and authenticate condition. If
							the user is not authenticated he will be redirected to the login
							page and the user can only access the authenticated routes If he
							is authenticated (Logged in).
						</Item>
						<Item title="What is Node? How does Node work?">
							Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform, back-end JavaScript
							runtime environment that runs on a JavaScript Engine (i.e. V8
							engine) and executes JavaScript code outside a web browser, which
							was designed to build scalable network applications.
							<br />
							Node JS Web Server internally maintains a Limited Thread pool to
							provide services to the Client Requests. Node JS Web Server
							receives those requests and places them into a Queue. It is known
							as “Event Queue”. Node JS Web Server internally has a Component,
							known as “Event Loop”.
